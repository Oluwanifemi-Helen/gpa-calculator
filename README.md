## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Planning
The GPA Calculator was planned to help students calculate their GPA easily by entering course details, credit units, and grades.

### 2. Requirements Analysis
The system requires:
- Input of multiple courses
- Credit units for each course
- Grades from A to F
- Automatic GPA calculation

### 3. System Design
The system is designed as a console-based Python application.
It uses variables, loops, and conditional statements to process user input and compute GPA.

### 4. Implementation
The project was implemented using Python.
The program accepts user input, converts grades to grade points, calculates quality points, and computes the GPA.

### 5. Testing
The system was tested using different grades and credit units to ensure correct GPA calculation and error-free execution.

### 6. Deployment
The application was deployed by pushing the source code to a GitHub repository for access and submission.

### 7. Maintenance
The system can be maintained by updating grading rules or adding new features when required.
